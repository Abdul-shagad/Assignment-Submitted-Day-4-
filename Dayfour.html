    <p class="bggreen"> My name is Abdul shagad and I am 17 years old. My birthday is on 12th December. I live in Pondicherry with My Parents. I have raised a pet cat named minnu who is 1 year old. Every morning after I wake up, freshen up and get ready for my school. Before going to school, I will pack my bag and tiffin. After school time is finished, I will spend my time playing with my friends. In the evenings, I will watch my favorite cartoon Tom and Jerry.
        After that, I will complete my homework and have dinner with my family. After dinner, I will talk with my mother spend some time with her then i went to sleep. I always love in a happy and peaceful environment.</p>
